However, running a Jupyter server on your local machine can be challenging, especially if you're working with large datasets or complex models that require significant computing power. One solution is to run a Jupyter server in a private Linux server for better performance, increased security, and the ability to collaborate with other team members.\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll show you how to create a Dockerized Jupyter server on a private Linux server. From installing Docker to running the Jupyter server and accessing it from your local machine, we'll cover everything. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a Jupyter Lab instance running in a Docker container on your private Linux server, and you'll be able to access it from any web browser on your local machine. So, if you're a data scientist or machine learning engineer looking to scale your Jupyter server, let's get started!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore we dive into the tutorial, let's make sure you have the right tools and knowledge to follow along. Here are the prerequisites for this tutorial:\n\n- A Linux server with a public IP address\n- Basic knowledge of the Linux command line\n- A web browser (preferably Google Chrome) installed on your local machine\n\nIf you don't have a Linux server set up, you can create one using a cloud provider like AWS or DigitalOcean. For this tutorial, we'll assume you have a server up and running.\n\n## Step 1: Connect to Your Linux Server\n\nTo get started, the first thing you need to do is connect to your private Linux server via SSH. To connect to your server, you will need the server's IP address and the login credentials (username and password). If you don't have this information, contact your server administrator.\n\nOnce you have the necessary information, open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine and type the following command, replacing `username{:bash}` and `server_ip{:bash}` with your actual login credentials and server IP address, respectively:\n\n```bash\nssh username@server_ip\n```\n\nYou will be prompted to enter your password. After entering your password, you will be logged into your Linux server.\n\n## Step 2: Install Docker\n\nTo install Docker on your Linux server, you can follow the official Docker installation guide. However, we'll show you how to install Docker on Ubuntu 20.04 in this tutorial. If you're using a different Linux distribution, you can find the installation instructions for your distribution on the official Docker website.\n\nTo install Docker on Ubuntu 20.04, first, update the package index and install the required packages:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install \\\n    apt-transport-https \\\n    ca-certificates \\\n    curl \\\n    gnupg \\\n    lsb-release\n```\n\nNext, add the Docker's official GPG key:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg\n```\n\nThen, add the Docker repository to the APT sources list:\n\n```bash\necho \\\n  \"deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\n  $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null\n```\n\nFinally, update the package index and install Docker:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n```\n\nTo verify that Docker is installed correctly, run the following command:\n\n```bash\ndocker --version\n```\n\nYou should see the docker version number in the output. If you see an error message, make sure you followed the steps correctly.\n\n## Step 3: Create a Folder for Your Jupyter Server\n\nNow that you have Docker installed, the next step is to create a folder for your Jupyter server. All the files and folders related to your Jupyter server will be stored in this folder. To create a folder, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nmkdir ~/jupyter-server\n```\n\nNavigate to the newly created folder using the `cd{:bash}` command:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/jupyter-server\n```\n\n## Step 4: Create a `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` File\n\nThe next step is to create a `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` file in the `jupyter-server{:bash}` folder. This file will contain the configuration for your Jupyter server. To create the file, run the following command:\n\n```bash\ntouch docker-compose.yml\n```\n\nOpen the file using your favorite text editor. For this tutorial, we'll use the `nano{:bash}` editor:\n\n```bash\nnano docker-compose.yml\n```\n\nAdd the following configuration to the file (we will explain each line in the next section):\n\n```yaml title=\"docker-compose.yml\" Show\nversion: \"3\"\n\nservices:\n  jupyter:\n    image: jupyter/minimal-notebook\n    hostname: jupyter\n    container_name: jupyter\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - CHOWN_EXTRA=/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work\n      - CHOWN_EXTRA_OPTS=-R\n      - NB_UID=1000\n      - NB_GID=100\n      - NB_USER=${NOTEBOOK_USER}\n      - NB_GROUP=users\n      - JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes\n      - CHOWN_HOME=yes\n      - CHOWN_HOME_OPTS=-R\n      - JUPYTER_TOKEN=${JUPYTER_TOKEN}\n      - PASSWORD_HASH=${PASSWORD_HASH}\n      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all\n    runtime: nvidia\n    ports:\n      - \"8888:8888\"\n    volumes:\n      - ${PWD}/work:/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work\n      - ${PWD}/work/environments:/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work/environments\n    working_dir: /home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work\n    command:\n      /bin/bash -c \"if ls /home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work/environments/*.yml >/dev/null 2>&1; then \\\n      for f in /home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work/environments/*.yml; do \\\n      env_name=$$(basename $${f%.yml}); \\\n      if conda env list | grep -q $${env_name}; then \\\n      echo \\\"Environment $${env_name} already exists. Skipping...\\\"; \\\n      else \\\n      echo \\\"Creating environment $${env_name}...\\\"; \\\n      conda env create --quiet --name $${env_name} --file $${f}; \\\n      fi; \\\n      done; \\\n      else \\\n      echo \\\"No environment files found. Creating default environment...\\\"; \\\n      conda install --quiet --yes numpy; \\\n      fi && \\\n      conda clean --all -f -y && \\\n      fix-permissions \\\"/opt/conda\\\" && \\\n      fix-permissions \\\"/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}\\\" && \\\n      start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token='${JUPYTER_TOKEN}' --NotebookApp.allow_password_change=True --NotebookApp.password='${PASSWORD_HASH}'\"\n    user: root\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n```\n\nLet's go over each line of the configuration file and explain what it does.\n\n- `version: \"3\"{:yaml}`: This line specifies the version of the `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` file. We are using version 3 in this tutorial.\n- `services:{:yaml}` This line specifies the services that will be running in the Docker container. In this case, we are only running one service, which is the Jupyter server.\n- `jupyter:{:yaml}` This line specifies the name of the service. We are calling it `jupyter{:yaml}`.\n- `image: jupyter/minimal-notebook{:yaml}`: This line specifies the Docker image that will be used to run the Jupyter server. We are using the `jupyter/minimal-notebook{:yaml}` image in this tutorial. You can find more information about this image on the official [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/minimal-notebook).\n- `hostname: jupyter{:yaml}`: This line specifies the hostname of the Jupyter server. We are calling it `jupyter{:yaml}`, but you can change it to whatever you want.\n- `container_name: jupyter{:yaml}`: This line specifies the name of the Docker container. We are calling it `jupyter{:yaml}`.\n- `restart: unless-stopped{:yaml}`: This line specifies the restart policy for the Docker container. If the container is stopped, it will be restarted unless it is explicitly stopped. There are other restart policies that you can use. You can find more information about restart policies on the official [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/).\n- `environment:{:yaml}` This line specifies the environment variables that will be used by the Jupyter server. We will go over each environment variables.\n- `CHOWN_EXTRA: /home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the folder that will be owned by the `NOTEBOOK_USER{:yaml}` user. We are setting it to `/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work{:yaml}`.\n- `CHOWN_EXTRA_OPTS: -R{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the options that will be used when changing the ownership of the folder specified in the `CHOWN_EXTRA{:yaml}` environment variable. We are setting it to `-R{:yaml}` to recursively change the ownership of all the files and folders in the specified folder.\n- `NB_UID: 1000{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the user ID of the `NOTEBOOK_USER{:yaml}` user. We are setting it to `1000{:yaml}` by default.\n- `NB_GID: 100{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the group ID of the `NOTEBOOK_USER{:yaml}` user. We are setting it to `100{:yaml}` by default.\n- `NB_USER: ${NOTEBOOK_USER}{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the username of the `NOTEBOOK_USER{:yaml}` user. We are setting it to `${NOTEBOOK_USER}{:yaml}`, we will explain how this variable is set in the next section.\n- `NB_GROUP: users{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the group of the `NOTEBOOK_USER{:yaml}` user. We are setting it to `users{:yaml}`, as the `users{:yaml}` group is the default group for the `NOTEBOOK_USER{:yaml}` user.\n- `JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB: yes{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies whether JupyterLab will be enabled. We are setting it to `yes{:yaml}` to enable JupyterLab.\n- `CHOWN_HOME: yes{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies whether the home folder of the `NOTEBOOK_USER{:yaml}` user will be owned by the `NOTEBOOK_USER{:yaml}` user. We are setting it to `yes{:yaml}` to change the ownership of the home folder.\n- `CHOWN_HOME_OPTS: -R{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the options that will be used when changing the ownership of the home folder of the `NOTEBOOK_USER{:yaml}` user. We are setting it to `-R{:yaml}` to recursively change the ownership of all the files and folders in the home folder.\n- `JUPYTER_TOKEN: ${JUPYTER_TOKEN}{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the token that will be used to access the Jupyter server. We are setting it to `${JUPYTER_TOKEN}{:yaml}`, we will explain how this variable is set in the next section.\n- `PASSWORD_HASH: ${PASSWORD_HASH}{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the password hash that will be used to access the Jupyter server. We are setting it to `${PASSWORD_HASH}{:yaml}`, we will explain how this variable is set in the next section.\n- `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: all{:yaml}`: This environment variable specifies the GPUs that will be visible to the Jupyter server. We are setting it to `all{:yaml}` to make all the GPUs visible to the Jupyter server.\n- `runtime: nvidia{:yaml}`: This line specifies the runtime that will be used to run the Docker container. We are using the `nvidia{:yaml}` runtime in this tutorial. You can find more information about the `nvidia{:yaml}` runtime on the official [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu).\n- `ports:{:yaml}` This line specifies the ports that will be exposed by the Docker container. We are exposing the port `8888{:yaml}` in this tutorial, which is the default port used by the Jupyter server.\n- `volumes:{:yaml}` This line specifies the volumes that will be mounted in the Docker container.\n- `./work:/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work{:yaml}`: This volume specifies the folder that will be mounted in the Docker container. We are mounting the `./work{:yaml}` folder in the host machine in the `/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work{:yaml}` folder in the Docker container. Everything that is saved in the `/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work{:yaml}` folder in the Docker container will be saved in the `./work{:yaml}` folder in the host machine.\n- `./work/environments:/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work/environments{:yaml}`: Similarly to the previous volume, this volume specifies the folder that will be mounted in the Docker container. We are mounting the `./work/environments{:yaml}` folder in the host machine in the `/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work/environments{:yaml}` folder in the Docker container. We will use this folder to store the environment files that will be used to save the Conda environments.\n- `working_dir: /home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work{:yaml}`: This line specifies the working directory of the Docker container. We are setting it to `/home/${NOTEBOOK_USER}/work{:yaml}`.\n- `command{:yaml}`: This line specifies the command that will be executed when the container starts. It first checks if any environment files exist in the environments directory, creates a Conda environment for each one if it does, and installs a default environment if it does not. It then cleans up the Conda environment and starts the Jupyter server.\n- `user: root{:yaml}`: This line specifies the user that will be used to run the Docker container. We are setting it to `root{:yaml}` to run the Docker container as the root user.\n- `env_file:{:yaml}` This line specifies the environment file that will be used by the Docker container. We are using the `.env{:yaml}` file in this tutorial to set the environment variables. We will go over the environment variables in the next section.\n\n## Step 5: Set the Environment Variables\n\nThe environment variables that we used in the `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` file are set in the `.env{:bash}` file. It is a good practice to set the environment variables in a separate file instead of setting them directly in the `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` file. This way, you can easily change the environment variables without having to change the `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` file. Also your passwords and tokens will not be exposed in the `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` file.\n\nCreate a new file called `.env{:bash}` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` file. Use the following command to create the `.env{:bash}` file:\n\n```bash\ntouch .env\n```\n\nOpen the `.env{:bash}` file in your favorite text editor and add the following environment variables:\n\n```bash\nJUPYTER_TOKEN=your_jupyter_token\nPASSWORD_HASH=your_password_hash\nNOTEBOOK_USER=your_notebook_user\n```\n\nReplace `your_jupyter_token{:bash}` with a random string of your choice to use as your Jupyter token. This will be used to authenticate yourself to the notebook server.\n\nTo create a hashed password, you can use the `passwd(){:bash}` function from the `notebook.auth{:bash}` module in a Python shell or Jupyter notebook. This will output a hashed version of your password that you can copy and paste into your `.env{:bash}` file as the value of the `PASSWORD_HASH{:bash}` environment variable.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to use the password \"mysecretpassword\", you would enter the following in the Python shell:\n\n```bash\npython -c 'from notebook.auth import passwd; print(passwd(passphrase=\"mysecretpassword\", algorithm=\"sha1\"))'\n```\n\nThis will output a hashed version of your password like the following:\n\n```bash\nsha1:143bfff689ac:37498bc69b8314a00dd31f6041e4f88b64dae038\n```\n\nCopy and paste the hashed version of your password into the `.env{:bash}` file as the value of the `PASSWORD_HASH{:bash}` environment variable.\n\nReplace `your_notebook_user{:bash}` with the name of the user that you want to use to access the Jupyter server. This user will be created inside the Docker container and will be used to run the Jupyter server.\n\n## Step 6: Build and Run the Docker Container\n\nNow that we have created the `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` file and the `.env{:bash}` file, we can build and run the Docker container. To build and run the Docker container, use the following command:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nThis command will build the Docker container and run it in the background. You can check the status of the Docker container using the following command:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose ps\n```\n\nThis command will output the status of the Docker container. You should see the following output:\n\n```bash\nName                Command               State           Ports\n----------------------------------------------------------------\njupyter   /bin/bash /home/jupyter/ ...   Up\n```\n\nNow that the Docker container is running, you can access the Jupyter server by going to `http://<your_server_ip>:8888{:bash}` in your browser. You should see the Jupyter login page. Enter the Jupyter token that you set in the `.env{:bash}` file as the password to access the Jupyter server.\n\n## Step 7: Activate Conda base Environment and create a new Environment\n\nNow that you have access to the Jupyter server, you can create a new Conda environment and install the packages that you need. Open a new terminal in the Jupyter server and activate the Conda base environment using the following command:\n\n```bash\nsource activate base\n```\n\nNow that you are in the Conda base environment, you can create a new Conda environment using the following command:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n myenv python=3.10\n```\n\nThis command will create a new Conda environment called `myenv{:bash}` with Python version 3.10. You can activate the new Conda environment using the following command:\n\n```bash\nconda activate myenv\n```\n\nNow that you are in the new Conda environment, you can install the packages that you need using the `conda install{:bash}` command. For example, if you wanted to install the `numpy{:bash}` package, you would use the following command:\n\n```bash\nconda install numpy\n```\n\n## Step 8: Use the new Environment in a Jupyter Notebook\n\nNow that you have created a new Conda environment and installed the packages that you need, you can use the new Conda environment in a Jupyter notebook. To use the new Conda environment in a Jupyter notebook, you need to install the `ipykernel{:bash}` package in the new Conda environment. You can install the `ipykernel{:bash}` package using the following command:\n\n```bash\nconda install ipykernel\n```\n\nNow that you have installed the `ipykernel{:bash}` package, you can use the new Conda environment in a Jupyter notebook. To use the new Conda environment in a Jupyter notebook, you need to create a new kernel for the new Conda environment. You can create a new kernel for the new Conda environment using the following command:\n\n```bash\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name \"Python (myenv)\"\n```\n\nThis command will create a new kernel for the new Conda environment called `Python (myenv){:bash}`. You can now use the new Conda environment in a Jupyter notebook. To use the new Conda environment in a Jupyter notebook, you need to select the `Python (myenv){:bash}` kernel from the kernel menu in the Jupyter notebook.\n\n## Step 9: Save the new Environment to a YAML file\n\nNow that you have created a new Conda environment and installed the packages that you need, you can save the new Conda environment to a YAML file. To save the new Conda environment to a YAML file, you need to export the new Conda environment to a YAML file. You can export the new Conda environment to a YAML file using the following command:\n\n```bash\nconda env export > environments/myenv.yml\n```\n\nThe above command exports the newly created Conda environment to a YAML file named `myenv.yml{:bash}` within the `environments{:bash}` directory. This step is crucial because if the docker container is stopped or deleted, the exported YAML file can be used to restore all the packages installed in the Conda environment during the next start of the docker container. As the `docker-compose.yml{:bash}` file automatically restores the packages, you only need to ensure that you export and save the Conda environment to a YAML file after any modifications.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThat's it! We've covered a lot of ground in this blog post! We started with the basics of Jupyter Notebook, and then explored how to set up a secure Jupyter Notebook server on a remote machine. By the end of this post, you should have a Jupyter Notebook server that is accessible over the internet, and secured with a password and token-based authentication.\n\nRemember, it's important to keep your Jupyter Notebook server secure, especially if you're working with sensitive data.

It is named after the famous mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who introduced the concept in the early 19th century.\n\nThe Gaussian distribution is defined by its bell-shaped curve, which is symmetric around its mean and characterized by its mean and standard deviation. Understanding the properties and applications of this distribution is crucial for various statistical and machine learning techniques, making it a fundamental concept in data science.\n\nIn this blog post, we will delve deeper into the Gaussian distribution and explore its mathematical definition, properties, and numerous applications. By the end of this post, you will have a solid understanding of this important concept and be equipped to use it in various data analysis tasks.\n\n## Probability Density Function (PDF)\n\nThe Gaussian distribution is characterized by its probability density function (PDF), which is given by the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mu$ is the mean of the distribution, and $\\sigma$ is its standard deviation. The formula tells us that the probability density of a value $x$ in the distribution is proportional to the distance of $x$ from the mean, and inversely proportional to the spread of the distribution. In other words, the probability of finding a value $x$ in a given range is higher if that range is closer to the mean and narrower if the standard deviation is small.\n\n## The Empirical Rule and the Z-Score\n\nThe empirical rule is a statistical rule of thumb that can be used to estimate the proportion of values within a certain number of standard deviations from the mean in a Gaussian distribution. It is also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule or the three-sigma rule.\n\nAccording to the empirical rule:\n\n- About 68% of the values in a Gaussian distribution will fall within one standard deviation of the mean.\n- About 95% of the values will fall within two standard deviations of the mean.\n- About 99.7% of the values will fall within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\nThe following image shows a Gaussian distribution curve with the empirical rule overlaid:\n\n<img\n  src=\"/images/content/exploring-gaussian-distribution/empirical-rule.png\"\n  alt=\"Empirical Rule\"\n  sizes=\"100vw\"\n  width=\"70%\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n  className=\"mx-auto pt-4\"\n/>\n\nThe green area in the image represents the proportion of values that fall within one standard deviation of the mean, the yellow area represents the proportion of values that fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and the red area represents the proportion of values that fall within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\nTo measure how far a value is from the mean in a Gaussian distribution, we can use the z-score, which is a measure of how many standard deviations a value is from the mean. The formula for calculating the z-score is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $x$ is the value being measured, $\\mu$ is the mean of the distribution, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a value is above or below the mean of the distribution. For example, if the z-score of a value $x$ is 1, it means that $x$ is one standard deviation above the mean. If the z-score is -1, it means that $x$ is one standard deviation below the mean.\n\nThe area under the curve of the Gaussian distribution represents the probability of a value falling within a certain range. The total area under the curve is equal to 1, which means that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1. The area under the curve between two z-scores represents the probability of a value falling between those two values. For instance, the area under the curve between a z-score of -1 and a z-score of 1 represents the probability of a value falling within one standard deviation of the mean, which is approximately 68%. We can use the [z-table](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/z-table/) to find the area under the curve between two z-scores.\n\n## Solving an Example Problem\n\nLet's apply the concepts of the empirical rule and z-score to solve an example problem.\n\n### Problem Statement:\n\nSuppose that the weights of a certain population of people follow a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 70 kg and a standard deviation of 5 kg. What is the probability that a randomly selected person from this population weighs between 60 kg and 80 kg?\n\n### Solution:\n\nFirst, we can calculate the z-scores for the weights of $60$ kg and $80$ kg using the formula:\n\n$$\nz_{60} = \\frac{60 - 70}{5} = -2\n$$\n\n$$\nz_{80} = \\frac{80 - 70}{5} = 2\n$$\n\nNext, we can use a z-value table to find the area under the curve between the z-scores of $-2$ and $2$. From the table, we find that the area under the curve between a z-score of $-2$ and $2$ is approximately $0.9545$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected person from this population weighs between $60$ kg and $80$ kg is approximately $0.9545$, or $95.45\\%$.\n\nUsing the empirical rule, we can also estimate the proportion of weights that fall within one, two, and three standard deviations from the mean. Since the standard deviation is $5$ kg, we can calculate the weight ranges as follows:\n\n- One standard deviation: $70$ kg $\\pm$ $1 \\times 5$ kg $=$ $[65$ kg, $75$ kg$]$\n- Two standard deviations: $70$ kg $\\pm$ $2 \\times 5$ kg $=$ $[60$ kg, $80$ kg$]$\n- Three standard deviations: $70$ kg $\\pm$ $3 \\times 5$ kg $=$ $[55$ kg, $85$ kg$]$\n\nFrom the ranges, we can see that the weight range of $60$ kg to $80$ kg falls within two standard deviations from the mean. Therefore, we would expect approximately $95\\%$ of the population to have weights within this range, which agrees with the probability we calculated using z-scores and the z-value table.\n\n## Creating a Gaussian Distribution Plot in Python\n\nA Gaussian distribution, also known as a normal distribution, is a probability distribution that is commonly found in nature and statistics. In Python, we can easily generate a Gaussian distribution using the NumPy library and visualize it using Matplotlib.\n\nHere is a step by step guide to creating a Gaussian distribution plot in Python:\n\n<Step number=\"1\" title=\"Import the required libraries\" />\nThe first step is to import the necessary libraries, which are `numpy{:python}` and `matplotlib{:python}`:\n\n```python title=\"gaussian_distribution.py\"\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n\n<Step number=\"2\" title=\"Generate random data\" />\n\nNext, we can generate some random data from a Gaussian distribution using the `numpy.random.normal(){:python}` function. This function takes three arguments: the mean, the standard deviation, and the number of data points to generate. For example, to generate 1000 data points with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we can use the following code:\n\n```python title=\"gaussian_distribution.py\"\ndata = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)\n```\n\n<Step number=\"3\" title=\"Create a histogram\" />\n\nWe can create a histogram of the data using the `matplotlib.pyplot.hist(){:python}` function. This function takes the data as input, as well as some additional optional arguments, such as the number of bins to use for the histogram. Here's an example of how to create a histogram with 20 bins:\n\n```python title=\"gaussian_distribution.py\"\nplt.hist(data, bins=20, density=True, alpha=0.6)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `density=True{:python}` argument means that the histogram will be normalized to represent a probability distribution, and the `alpha=0.6{:python}` argument means that the bars in the histogram will be slightly transparent.\n\n<Step number=\"4\" title=\"Create a Gaussian distribution plot\" />\n\nTo plot a smooth bell curve that fits the histogram, we can use the `numpy{:python}` and `matplotlib{:python}` libraries to calculate and plot a probability density function (PDF) for the Gaussian distribution. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```python title=\"gaussian_distribution.py\"\n# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the data\nmu, std = np.mean(data), np.std(data)\n\n# Create an array of x-values ranging from mu - 4*std to mu + 4*std\nx = np.linspace(mu - 4*std, mu + 4*std, 100)\n\n# Calculate the PDF for the Gaussian distribution using the x-values, mean, and standard deviation\npdf = 1/(std * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) * np.exp(- (x - mu)**2 / (2 * std**2))\n\n# Plot the PDF as a line on top of the histogram\nplt.plot(x, pdf, color='red')\n```\n\nIn this code, the `np.linspace(){:python}` function creates an array of x-values ranging from 4 standard deviations below the mean to 4 standard deviations above the mean, and the `pdf{:python}` variable is calculated using the formula for the Gaussian probability density function. Finally, the `plt.plot(){:python}` function is used to plot the PDF as a red line on top of the histogram.\n\n<Step number=\"5\" title=\"Add labels and show the plot\" />\n\nFinally, we can add labels to the plot and show it using the `matplotlib.pyplot.xlabel(){:python}`, `matplotlib.pyplot.ylabel(){:python}`, and `matplotlib.pyplot.show(){:python}` functions:\n\n```python title=\"gaussian_distribution.py\"\nplt.xlabel('Data')\nplt.ylabel('Probability Density')\nplt.title('Histogram of Random Data with Fitted Gaussian Distribution Curve')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the complete code to generate a Gaussian distribution plot in Python looks like this:\n\n```python title=\"gaussian_distribution.py\"\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Generate random data from a Gaussian distribution\ndata = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)\n\n# Create a histogram of the data\nplt.hist(data, bins=20, density=True, alpha=0.6)\n\n# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the data\nmu, std = np.mean(data), np.std(data)\n\n# Create an array of x-values ranging from mu - 4*std to mu + 4*std\nx = np.linspace(mu - 4*std, mu + 4*std, 100)\n\n# Calculate the PDF for the Gaussian distribution using the x-values, mean, and standard deviation\npdf = 1/(std * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) * np.exp(- (x - mu)**2 / (2 * std**2))\n\n# Plot the PDF as a line on top of the histogram\nplt.plot(x, pdf, color='red')\n\n# Add labels and show the plot\nplt.xlabel('Data')\nplt.ylabel('Probability Density')\nplt.title('Histogram of Random Data with Fitted Gaussian Curve')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will generate a plot that shows the histogram of the random sample, along with a smooth bell-shaped curve that represents the probability density function of the Gaussian distribution:\n\n<img\n  src=\"/images/content/exploring-gaussian-distribution/fitted-gaussian.png\"\n  alt=\"Fitted Gaussian Distribution\"\n  sizes=\"100vw\"\n  width=\"70%\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n  className=\"mx-auto pt-4\"\n/>\n\nThis graph is a useful visual representation of a Gaussian distribution, and can be used to better understand the properties of this type of distribution.\n\n## Properties of the Gaussian Distribution\n\nThe Gaussian distribution has several important properties:\n\n- Symmetry: The Gaussian distribution is symmetric around its mean, which means that the left and right sides of the curve are mirror images of each other.\n- Unimodality: The Gaussian distribution has only one peak, so it is referred to as a unimodal distribution.\n- Asymptotic: The Gaussian distribution approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity.\n- Normalization: The Gaussian distribution integrates to $1$ over the entire real line, which means that the total area under the curve is equal to $1$.\n- Characterized by mean and standard deviation: The Gaussian distribution is completely characterized by its mean and standard deviation.\n\n## Using Gaussian Distribution in Real-World Applications\n\nThe Gaussian Distribution is used in many real-world applications, including:\n\n- Image Processing: Gaussian Distribution is used in image processing to filter out noise from images.\n- Data Analysis: Gaussian Distribution is used in data analysis to describe the distribution of data and to make predictions about future data.\n- Machine Learning: Gaussian Distribution is used in machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and Gaussian Mixture Models, to model the distribution of data and make predictions.\n- Weather Prediction: Gaussian Distribution is used in weather prediction to model the distribution of temperature and precipitation in a given region.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we learned about the Gaussian Distribution, which is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric, unimodal, and characterized by its mean and standard deviation. We also learned how to generate a Gaussian Distribution plot in Python using the `numpy{:python}` and `matplotlib{:python}` libraries, and we learned about some of the real-world applications of the Gaussian Distribution.

It is widely used in many fields, including physics, biology, economics, and engineering. The distribution is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, who first introduced it in the early 19th century.\n\nIn this post, we will explore the Poisson distribution in detail, including its probability density function, mean, variance, and applications. We will also discuss Poisson noise and how we can model it using the Poisson distribution. Let's get started!\n\n## What is the Poisson Distribution?\n\nPoisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. The distribution is often used to model rare events that occur randomly and independently of each other. The Poisson distribution has many practical applications, including modeling the number of traffic accidents in a given time period or the number of bacteria in a culture after a certain time.\n\nThe Poisson distribution is characterized by a single parameter, denoted by $\\lambda$ (lambda), which represents the mean number of events that occur in the given interval. The probability of observing $k$ events in the interval is given by the Poisson probability mass function (PMF):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $P(X=k)$ is the probability of $k$ events occurring in the interval, $e$ is the mathematical constant approximately equal to $2.71828$, and $\\lambda$ is the mean number of events.\n\nThe Poisson distribution has several important properties, including its mean and variance, which we will explore in the following section.\n\n## Mean and Variance of the Poisson Distribution\n\nThe mean, or expected value, of a Poisson distribution is denoted by $\\lambda$, which represents the average number of events that occur in the given interval. It is also equal to the variance of the distribution.\n\nThe formula for the mean of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n\n$$\n\\mu = E(X) = \\lambda\n$$\n\nwhere $E(X)$ denotes the expected value of the random variable $X$.\n\nThe formula for the variance of a Poisson distribution is:\n\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = Var(X) = \\lambda\n$$\n\nwhere $Var(X)$ denotes the variance of the random variable $X$.\n\nThis means that the standard deviation of a Poisson distribution is:\n\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nThe mean and variance of the Poisson distribution have important implications in many real-world applications. For example, if we know the average number of traffic accidents that occur in a certain area, we can use the Poisson distribution to estimate the probability of a certain number of accidents occurring in a given time period. Similarly, if we know the average number of customers that visit a store in a day, we can use the Poisson distribution to model the probability of a certain number of customers visiting the store in a given time period.\n\nIn the next section, we will explore some examples of Poisson distributions in real-world applications.\n\n## Real-World Applications of the Poisson Distribution\n\nSuppose a restaurant receives an average of $5$ customer complaints per day. The number of customer complaints follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = 5$. We can use the Poisson probability mass function to find the probability of observing a specific number of complaints in a day. For example, what is the probability of receiving exactly $3$ complaints in a day?\n\nUsing the Poisson PMF, we have:\n\n$$\nP(X=3) = \\frac{5^3 e^{-5}}{3!} \\approx 0.1404\n$$\n\nSo the probability of receiving exactly $3$ complaints in a day is approximately $0.1404$ or $14.04\\%$.\n\nThis is just one example of how the Poisson distribution can be used in the real world to model the occurrence of rare events.\n\n## Other Uses of the Poisson Distribution\n\nThe Poisson distribution is used in a wide range of applications, including astronomy, biology, economics, and physics. Here are some examples of the Poisson distribution in action:\n\n1. **Astronomy:** Astronomers use the Poisson distribution to model the arrival of cosmic rays and the number of photons received from distant stars and galaxies. These events are rare, and their occurrence can be modeled using the Poisson distribution.\n\n2. **Biology:** The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of mutations that occur in DNA sequences, the number of bacteria in a culture, and the number of cells in a tissue sample.\n\n3. **Economics:** The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of claims made to an insurance company, the number of customers in a queue, and the number of failures in a production process.\n\n4. **Physics:** The Poisson distribution is used to model the arrival of particles in a detector, the number of decays of a radioactive source, and the number of photons emitted by a laser.\n\n## Visualize the Poisson Distribution with Python\n\nIn this section, we will use Python to visualize the Poisson distribution. We will use the `scipy.stats{:python}` module to generate random samples from the Poisson distribution and plot the probability mass function (PMF).\n\nLet's start by importing the necessary libraries:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import poisson\n```\n\nNext, we will define the mean of the Poisson distribution, which is denoted by $\\lambda$. We will use $\\lambda = 5$ for this example:\n\n```python\nlambda_ = 5\n```\n\nNow, we will generate 1000 random samples from the Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = 5$:\n\n```python\nsamples = poisson.rvs(mu=lambda_, size=1000)\n```\n\nWe can use the `np.unique(){:python}` function to find the unique values and their corresponding counts in the samples:\n\n```python\nunique, counts = np.unique(samples, return_counts=True)\n```\n\nWe can use the `plt.bar(){:python}` function to plot the probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution:\n\n```python\nplt.bar(unique, counts/1000)\nplt.ylabel('Probability')\nplt.xlabel('Number of events')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nAfter running the code, we get the following PMF plot:\n\n<img\n  src=\"/images/content/poisson-distribution/poisson_pmf_plot.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Poisson PMF\"\n  sizes=\"100vw\"\n  width=\"70%\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n  className=\"mx-auto pt-4\"\n/>\n\nWe can see that the probability mass function is right skewed and has a long tail to the right. This means that the probability of observing a large number of events is very small. For example, the probability of observing $10$ events is approximately $0.025$ which is very small compared to the probability of observing $5$ events, which is approximately $0.175$.\n\nThis visualization can be applied to many real-world scenarios, including modeling the number of cosmic rays detected in a particular time period or the number of supernova explosions observed in a particular region of the sky. By using the Poisson distribution to model such rare events, we can gain insights into the likelihood of these events occurring and make predictions about future observations.\n\nThe final code for this section is given below:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import poisson\n\nlambda_ = 5\n\nsamples = poisson.rvs(mu=lambda_, size=1000)\n\nunique, counts = np.unique(samples, return_counts=True)\n\nplt.bar(unique, counts/1000)\nplt.xlabel('Number of Events')\nplt.ylabel('Probability')\nplt.title('Poisson Distribution PMF')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n## Properties of the Poisson Distribution\n\nThe Poisson distribution has following important properties:\n\n- The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution, which means that it can only take on discrete values. For example, the number of traffic accidents in a day cannot be a fraction, and it can only take on integer values.\n- The Poisson distribution is a memoryless distribution, which means that the probability of observing a certain number of events in the future is independent of the number of events that occurred in the past. For example, the probability of observing $3$ traffic accidents in a day is independent of the number of accidents that occurred in the previous days.\n- The Poisson distribution is a non-negative distribution, which means that it can only take on non-negative values. For example, the number of traffic accidents in a day cannot be negative.\n- The Poisson distribution right skewed, which means that the probability of observing a large number of events is higher than the probability of observing a small number of events. For example, the probability of observing $10$ traffic accidents in a day is higher than the probability of observing $1$ traffic accident in a day.\n\n## Poison noise\n\nPoisson noise is a type of noise that arises when counting rare events that follow a Poisson distribution. Poisson noise is the result of the statistical fluctuations of the number of events occurring in a given interval.\n\nFor example, in astronomy, Poisson noise is often encountered when counting photons from distant celestial objects. The number of photons detected by a telescope follows a Poisson distribution, and the statistical fluctuations in the number of photons result in Poisson noise. Understanding the level of Poisson noise is important in determining the uncertainty in the measurements, and hence the accuracy of the resulting scientific conclusions.\n\n### Example problem\n\nSuppose we have counted a total of 10,000 photoelectrons over a period of 10 minutes from incoming photons at a CCD pixel of an astronomical telescope. What is the noise level or uncertainty in that photoelectron count?\n\n### Solution with Python\n\nWe can use the Poisson distribution to calculate the uncertainty in the photoelectron count. Since the Poisson distribution has a variance equal to its mean, we can estimate the mean photoelectron count as the total number of photoelectrons divided by the measurement time. In this case, the mean photoelectron count is:\n\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{10,000}{10 , \\text{minutes}} = 1,000 , \\text{photoelectrons/minute}\n$$\n\nUsing this mean value, we can calculate the standard deviation or uncertainty of the photoelectron count as:\n\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{1,000} \\approx 31.6 , \\text{photoelectrons/minute}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the Poisson noise or uncertainty in the photoelectron count is approximately 31.6 photoelectrons per minute.\n\nWe can also verify this result using Python. Here is an example code snippet that calculates the uncertainty in the photoelectron count using the Poisson distribution:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import poisson\n\ntotal_photoelectrons = 10000\nmeasurement_time = 10 # minutes\n\nmean_photoelectrons = total_photoelectrons / measurement_time\nprint(\"Mean photoelectron count:\", mean_photoelectrons)\n\nstd_photoelectrons = np.sqrt(mean_photoelectrons)\nprint(\"Standard deviation or uncertainty:\", std_photoelectrons)\n\n# Poisson distribution\npoisson_dist = poisson(mu=mean_photoelectrons)\n\n# Probability of measuring exactly the mean value\nprob_mean = poisson_dist.pmf(mean_photoelectrons)\nprint(\"Probability of measuring exactly the mean value:\", prob_mean)\n```\n\nAfter running the code, we get the following output:\n\n```bash\nMean photoelectron count: 1000.0\nStandard deviation or uncertainty: 31.622776601683793\nProbability of measuring exactly the mean value: 0.01261461134870819\n```\n\nWe have used the `scipy.stats{:python}` module to create a Poisson distribution with the estimated mean photoelectron count, and then calculates the probability of measuring exactly the mean value. The resulting probability is small, indicating that the actual photoelectron count is likely to deviate from the mean value due to Poisson noise.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe poisson distribution is a useful tool for modeling the occurrence of rare events. Its properties, including its mean and variance, make it well-suited for a wide range of real-world applications. From modeling the arrival of customers at a store to understanding the behavior of photons in telescopes, the Poisson distribution has proven to be a valuable tool in many fields. With the help of Python, it is easier than ever to apply the Poisson distribution to real-world problems and gain insights into the behavior of rare events.\n",
